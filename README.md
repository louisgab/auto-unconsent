# Auto Unconsent

Chrome extension that unconsent common cookie consent popups

## Why

GDPR is a great thing but sometimes I get lazy and just click "Accept", even if I'm a big advocate of privacy.

Cognitive load should not constitute an explicit consent, isn't it?

This is a first draft, but a good beginning I think

## Usage

1. Download [last project build](https://github.com/louisgab/auto-unconsent/releases/latest/)
2. Unpack
3. Go to Chrome > More tools > Extensions
4. Load unpacked > Select your the dist folder
5. Boom it works, nothing to configure

## Scope

At the moment, only those providers are handled:

-   Cookiebot
-   Quantcast
-   Didomi

## Contributing

Highly welcomed! We need to unconsent more providers
