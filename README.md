# Auto Unconsent

> Chrome extension that unconsent common cookie consent popups

## Why

GDPR is a great thing but sometimes I get lazy and just click "Accept", even if I'm a big advocate of privacy.

Cognitive load should not constitute an explicit consent, isn't it?

This is a first draft, but a good beginning I think

(Currently under review on chrome web store)

## Scope

For the moment, only those providers are handled:

-   Cookiebot
-   Quantcast

## Contributing

Highly welcomed! We need to unconsent more providers
