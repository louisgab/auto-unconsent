# Auto Unconsent
> Chrome extension that unconsent common cookie consent popups

---

## Why
GDPR is a great thing but sometimes I get lazy and just click "Accept", even if I'm a big advocate of privacy
Laziness driven by cognitive load should not constitute an explicit consent, isn't it?
This is a first draft, but a good beginning I think

## Scope
Only those providers are handled:
- Cookiebot
- Quantcast

## Contributing
Highly welcomed! We need to unconsent more providers
